# UpLearn Video Skipper

**UpLearn Video Skipper** is some JavaScript code designed to help users skip through video lessons on UpLearn and go straight to the questions, saving time by avoiding the need to watch the entire video if they already know everything about that specific topic/video. The script locates the question times in a video and automatically skips to them.

## How It Works

In UpLearn video lessons, there are periodic in-video questions. This script uses the UpLearn API to fetch those questions and automatically skips to each question's corresponding timestamp in the video. When there are no more questions, the video will skip to the end.

## Features
- Skips directly to the in-video questions.
- Reduces time spent on watching unnecessary portions of the video.
- Easy to use

## Disclaimer

This script is intended for personal use to enhance learning efficiency on UpLearn by skipping through parts **you already know**, not to skip homework!
